# Dawnward: Brand & Design System

> A reference guide for Claude Code and contributors on how Dawnward should look, feel, and speak.

---

## Brand Positioning

**What it is:** A free, open-source jet lag optimization app that uses circadian science to help travelers arrive alert and adjusted.

**Tagline:** _Arrive ready, not wrecked._

**Core promise:** Personalized light, sleep, melatonin, and caffeine schedules generated by the same circadian models used in clinical research—accessible to everyone, not locked behind a $100/year subscription.

**Personality:**

- **Knowledgeable but not clinical** — We know the science; we don't lecture about it
- **Warm and supportive** — Jet lag sucks; we're here to help
- **Quietly confident** — The math works; we don't need to oversell
- **Practical** — Actionable advice, not abstract theory

**What we're not:**

- Not a wellness app with vague "optimize your sleep" vibes
- Not a medical device or replacement for professional advice
- Not gamified or pushy about engagement

## Visual Design

### Color Palette

The palette evokes a journey from dawn to dusk—the literal light cycle we're helping users navigate.

#### Primary Colors

| Name    | HSL           | Hex       | Usage                                   |
| ------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Sky     | `199 65% 55%` | `#3B9CC9` | Primary actions, links, travel elements |
| Sunrise | `16 85% 75%`  | `#F4A574` | Alerts, warmth, morning cues            |
| Sage    | `155 40% 65%` | `#7DBB9C` | Wellness, melatonin, positive states    |
| Sunset  | `35 85% 70%`  | `#E8B456` | Caffeine, energy, afternoon             |
| Night   | `255 45% 45%` | `#6B5BA3` | Sleep, evening, rest                    |

#### Semantic Usage

- **Light exposure interventions** → Sunrise/amber tones
- **Caffeine timing** → Sunset/orange tones
- **Melatonin** → Sage/green tones
- **Sleep targets** → Night/purple tones
- **Travel/flights** → Sky blue

#### Background Gradient

The app background flows from dawn to dusk:

```css
background: linear-gradient(
  180deg,
  hsl(199 80% 95%) 0%,
  /* Light sky blue - dawn */ hsl(199 70% 92%) 15%,
  /* Soft sky */ hsl(38 60% 96%) 35%,
  /* Warm cream - midday */ hsl(16 70% 94%) 55%,
  /* Peachy sunset */ hsl(280 50% 92%) 75%,
  /* Soft lavender - dusk */ hsl(265 45% 88%) 100%
    /* Deeper purple - night approaching */
);
```

### Typography

- **Font family:** System UI stack (`system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`)
- **No custom fonts** — Fast loading, native feel
- **Weights:** Regular (400) for body, Medium (500) for labels, Semibold (600) for headings
- **Avoid:** All caps, excessive bold, decorative fonts

### Spacing & Layout

- **Mobile-first** — Primary use case is checking schedules on a phone
- **Generous whitespace** — Cards breathe; nothing feels cramped
- **Border radius:** `0.625rem` (10px) — Soft but not bubbly
- **Cards:** White with subtle shadow, slight transparency (`bg-white/90`)
- **Max content width:** 768px for reading comfort, 1024px for forms

### Iconography

- **Source:** Lucide icons
- **Style:** Outlined, 1.5px stroke
- **Size:** 16px inline, 20-24px in cards, 32px+ for empty states
- **Semantic icons:**
  - ☀️ `Sun` — Light exposure
  - ☕ `Coffee` — Caffeine
  - 💊 `Pill` — Melatonin
  - 🌙 `Moon` — Sleep
  - ✈️ `Plane` — Travel/flights
  - 👓 `Glasses` — Blue light blocking
  - 🍽️ `Utensils` — Meal timing

### UI Patterns

**Schedule items:**

- Rounded cards with left-aligned icon in a colored circle
- Time displayed as a badge on the right
- Checkable with a circular checkbox
- Completed items: reduced opacity, strikethrough text, green check

**Progress indicators:**

- Horizontal progress bar for daily completion
- Percentage shown as fraction (e.g., "4 / 7")

**Empty states:**

- Centered icon (muted color, larger size)
- Brief headline + one line explanation
- Optional CTA button

**Forms:**

- Labels above inputs
- White input backgrounds
- Placeholder text for guidance, not labels
- Primary action at bottom, full width on mobile

## Language & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

1. **Direct but warm**
   - ✅ "Your plan was updated based on last night's sleep."
   - ❌ "We've taken the liberty of adjusting your personalized optimization schedule."

2. **Explain the "why" briefly**
   - ✅ "Light exposure shifted to 8:30 AM because you fell asleep later than planned."
   - ❌ "Light exposure shifted to 8:30 AM." (no context)
   - ❌ "According to the phase response curve of the suprachiasmatic nucleus..." (too much)

3. **Use plain language**
   - ✅ "Bright light helps shift your body clock"
   - ❌ "Phototherapy entrains circadian oscillators"

4. **Be specific with times**
   - ✅ "Take melatonin at 9:30 PM"
   - ❌ "Take melatonin in the evening"

5. **Acknowledge the human experience**
   - ✅ "Jet lag is rough. Here's what will help."
   - ❌ "Follow this protocol for optimal circadian realignment."

### Example Email (Plan Changed)

```
Subject: Your Dawnward plan adjusted based on last night's sleep

Hi David,

Based on your Eight Sleep data, we've updated your jet lag plan for
SFO → SIN.

📊 What we noticed:
You fell asleep at 11:45 PM (target was 10:00 PM)

🔄 What changed:
• Light exposure: 7:00 AM → 8:30 AM
• Melatonin: 9:00 PM → 10:30 PM
• Target bedtime: 10:00 PM → 11:00 PM

📋 Today's schedule:
☀️  8:30 AM   Bright light (30 min outside or light box)
☕  2:00 PM   Caffeine cutoff
💊 10:30 PM   Melatonin (if using)
🛏️ 11:00 PM   Target bedtime

This adjustment helps your body catch up gradually rather than
forcing an unrealistic schedule.

—Dawnward
```

**Why this works:**

- Opens with the context (Eight Sleep triggered this)
- Shows what was observed → what changed → what to do
- Uses emoji sparingly to aid scanning
- Explains the rationale in one sentence
- Ends without asking for anything

### Intervention Descriptions

| Type          | Card text                | Detail text                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Light seek    | "Seek bright light"      | "Get outside or use a light box for 30+ minutes" |
| Light avoid   | "Avoid bright light"     | "Dim screens, wear blue blockers if needed"      |
| Melatonin     | "Take melatonin (0.5mg)" | "Low dose to help initiate sleep shift"          |
| Caffeine OK   | "Coffee window opens"    | "Caffeine is fine until your cutoff time"        |
| Caffeine stop | "Last caffeine"          | "No coffee, tea, or energy drinks after this"    |
| Sleep target  | "Target bedtime"         | "[X] earlier/later than your usual time"         |
| Meal timing   | "Light early dinner"     | "Eating earlier helps shift your rhythm"         |

### Error Messages

- **Connection failed:** "Couldn't reach Eight Sleep. We'll try again in a few hours."
- **Invalid input:** "That doesn't look like a valid time. Try something like 10:30 PM."
- **No plan yet:** "Add your flight details to get started."

### Microcopy

- Button to generate schedule: "Generate My Schedule" (not "Submit" or "Calculate")
- Calendar CTA: "Add to Calendar" (not "Sync" or "Export")
- Sign in: "Sign in with Google" (not "Login" or "Authenticate")
- Empty history: "No trips yet — Your completed schedules will appear here"

## Email Design

### Design Philosophy

Emails are a critical touchpoint—they arrive when users need guidance most. The design prioritizes clarity and scannability over visual flair.

| Principle              | Implementation                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plain text aesthetic   | No images, no HTML-heavy layouts. Works in any email client.        |
| One CTA maximum        | "View your full schedule" link only. No social, no upsells.         |
| Mobile-first           | 600px max width, large tap targets, readable on small screens       |
| Monospace for schedule | Schedule blocks use monospace font for alignment and quick scanning |
| Emoji as icons         | Sparingly used (sun, coffee, pill, moon) to aid visual scanning     |
| Respectful timing      | Never before 6 AM or after 10 PM in the user's timezone             |

### Email Structure

All transactional emails follow this structure:

1. **Greeting** — Personalized if name available, otherwise omitted
2. **Context line** — What this email is about (flight route, date)
3. **Schedule content** — The interventions, formatted for scannability
4. **Single CTA** — Link to view full schedule in app (optional)
5. **Sign-off** — "—Dawnward" (no marketing footer, no social links)
6. **Footer** — Unsubscribe link, legal text (minimal)

### Email Colors

Emails use a minimal subset of the brand palette:

| Element             | Color                 | Notes                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Background          | `#f8fafc` (slate-50)  | Soft gray, not harsh white    |
| Content card        | `#ffffff`             | White card on gray background |
| Body text           | `#334155` (slate-700) | Dark enough for readability   |
| Primary link/button | `#3B9CC9` (Sky)       | Matches app primary color     |
| Schedule background | `#f1f5f9` (slate-100) | Subtle highlight for schedule |
| Dividers            | `#e2e8f0` (slate-200) | Thin, unobtrusive             |

### Send Timing

Flight day emails are timed to arrive when useful:

| Scenario                 | Send time                    | Rationale                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Default                  | 5:00 AM local (departure TZ) | Catch users as they wake on travel day     |
| Early first intervention | 7:00 PM night before         | If <3h between 5 AM and first intervention |
| Adaptation days          | Not sent                     | Users check the app; no inbox clutter      |

**Never send:**

- Before 6:00 AM or after 10:00 PM in user's local timezone
- More than one email per trip per day
- Marketing content in transactional emails

## Component Guidelines

### Buttons

| Variant            | Usage                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary (Sky blue) | Main actions: "Generate My Schedule", "Add to Calendar" |
| Secondary          | Alternative actions: "Connect Eight Sleep"              |
| Ghost              | Navigation, tertiary actions: "Back", "Sign in"         |
| Outline            | Less prominent CTAs in cards                            |

### Cards

- Always white or white with slight transparency
- Use shadow-sm for elevation
- Use backdrop-blur-sm when over gradient backgrounds
- Dashed border for "connect" or empty state cards

### Badges

- Use for metadata: "+16h shift", "Jan 28"
- Muted colors, no harsh borders
- Don't overuse—one or two per card max

### Switches

- Use for user preferences (melatonin yes/no, caffeine yes/no)
- Always paired with a label and brief description
- Sky blue when active

---

## Accessibility

- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for body text
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Icons paired with text or aria-labels
- Focus states use ring with Sky color
- Avoid conveying information through color alone

---

## Open Source Considerations

- MIT license — attribution appreciated but not required
- README should explain the science briefly
- Credit Arcascope for the circadian library
- "Not medical advice" in footer
- Credit Arcascope for the circadian library
